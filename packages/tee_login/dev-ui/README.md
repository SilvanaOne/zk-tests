Please build a Silvana TEE login page on @page.tsx

The page should demo the login functionality:

- Login with 2 Sui wallets
- Login with 2 Solana wallets
- Login with 2 Ethereum wallets
- Social login (Google, GitHub)

Please have several dashboard:

- TEE status dashboard should show the following data received from rust backend
- User status dashboard should show user address used to login (Sui, Solana, Ethereum), Mina public key generated by Silvana TEE login, status of login and error in case there is an error, Sign button to sign the message and show the signature
- Social login dashboard should show status of login

Please use the professional design modern wallets are using.

You can see data structures and functions to interact with the code in src/app/(pages)/draft/page.tsx
@page.tsx . Do not use design from the example, only the data structures and functions
